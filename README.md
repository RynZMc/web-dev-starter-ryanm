# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview
This project is a simplistic website I created based on the specifications given
by CS408. 

To run this program, you simply clone the repo from github, download live preview
if you have not already, and then open the live preview window or open the url in
a new browser window. From there, you can check out the site and click the button
to return an alert box which says 'hello'.
